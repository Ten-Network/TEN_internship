        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p>
          By creating, becoming an Administrator (as defined below), or
          continuing as an Administrator of a page (the “Page”) on our Business
          Services, you are agreeing to enter into legally binding contract
          terms between TenInternships (as defined below and also referred to as
          “we”,“us” and “our” ) and your Organization (as defined below)
          represented by the Page. “Organization” means the business represented
          by your Page, which may only be a legal entity (such as a university
          or company) or you, if you are operating the business in your
          individual capacity (such as a sole proprietorship). You also
          represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into these
          contract terms on behalf of the Organization (collectively with the
          Organization, you and the other Administrators, if any, “You”). If You
          do not agree to this contract (the “Contract” or “Service Terms”), do
          not register as an Administrator and do not access or otherwise use
          any of our Business Services (including creating, claiming or
          continuing as an Administrator for the Page). In addition to the
          Service Terms, the TenInternships User Agreement, Privacy Policy and
          Cookie Policy apply to any use of our services. Additional terms may
          apply to specific features. For example, if You purchase premium
          features for the Page, such features may be subject to additional
          terms and payment obligations.

        <h2>Obligations</h2>
        <p>
          As with our other TenInternships services, our collection, use and sharing
          of Your personal data is subject to our Privacy Policy (which includes
          our Cookie Policy and other documents referenced in the Privacy
          Policy) and updates. You agree that You will comply with the Service
          Terms when collecting, using or otherwise processing any personal data
          related to Members. If You process data about Members (obtained either
          directly from TenInternships services, from any third party application that
          has integrated with TenInternships APIs, or otherwise), You must ensure
          that You have a legal basis for doing so and that Your processing is
          in compliance with applicable laws (including by clearly informing the
          Members about Your processing and obtaining their unambiguous consent
          where necessary). You are responsible for Your and Your agents’
          processing of this data, including with respect to any secondary uses,
          disclosures or transfers of the data.

        <h2>Intellectual</h2>
        <p>
          You grant to TenInternships (and its affiliates) a non-exclusive, worldwide,
          royalty-free, sublicensable and transferable license to use, copy,
          modify, distribute and publish any content You provide to TenInternships.
          The foregoing license survives termination of this Contract with
          regard to content provided prior to termination. You represent and
          warrant that you own or have all necessary rights (including
          intellectual property rights) to such content (including to grant the
          license above).

        <h2>Page service limitations</h2>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that:
          <br />
          <br />
          Any Administrator’s identity and actions related to the Page may be
          visible to others, including visitors and other Administrators of the
          Page.
          <br />
          <br />
          We may add or suspend any Administrator’s access to the Business
          Services (including administration of the Page) at any time at our own
          discretion.
          <br />
          <br />
          We may change or discontinue any of our services, including Business
          Services. In addition, TenInternships reserves the right to remove any Page
          on the Business Services at any time without notice, including all, or
          part of, the Page’s content.
          <br />
          <br />
          We may modify the Page in accordance with our policies. For example,
          we may modify the Organization name on the Page and add clarification
          statements to the Page to address member confusion or conflicting
          trademark rights. In addition, we may (a) restrict any name change and
          have no obligations to perform any change, merger or other request,
          and (b) determine how name changes will be represented on profiles and
          on other references to the Organization on TenInternships services.
          <br />
          <br />
          We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our
          Business Services (or other services) and can remove it in our sole
          discretion, with or without notice. TenInternships may be required by law to
          remove certain information or content in certain countries.
          <br />
          <br />
          We do not promise to store or keep showing any information and content
          that You have posted. We have no obligation to store, maintain or
          provide You a copy of any content or information that You or others
          provide, except to the extent required by applicable laws and as noted
          in our Privacy Policy.

          provide You notice through our Business Services (or by other means)
          to provide You the opportunity to review the changes before they
          become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If You
          object to any changes, You may terminate Your agreement to this

          <br />
          Termination of Contract. If You wish to terminate this Contract, at
          any time You can do so by (1) removing all Administrators of the Page,
          including Yourself (and others, if applicable); (2) deactivating the
          Page; (3) if you are the only Administrator, closing your TenInternships
          account; and/or (4) notifying TenInternships through Contact Us. TenInternships
          has no obligation to de-activate the Page (even after termination).

          You may not rely on any undertaking, promise, assurance, statement,
          representation, warranty or understanding of any person relating to
          the subject matter of the Contract, other than as stated in the
          Contract. We may notify you within the Business Services or via the
          contact information of one or more Administrators provided us (e.g.,
          email, mobile number, physical address of any Administrator and/or
          Organization). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.
          TenInternships accepts service of process at the address identified here.
          Any notices that You provide without compliance with this Section
          shall have no legal effect. If we do not act to enforce a breach of
          this Contract, that does not mean that TenInternships has waived its right
          to enforce this Contract. The Contract does not create a partnership,
          agency relationship, or joint venture between the parties. Neither
          party has the power or authority to bind the other or to create any
          obligation or responsibility on behalf of the other. Under no
          circumstances will any employee of one party be deemed to be the
          employee of the other. You may not assign this Contract in whole or in
          part without TenInternships’s prior written consent. Any attempted
          assignment in violation of this restriction is void. The Contract
          shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective
          successors and permitted assigns. If the Contract is translated into a
          language other than English, the translation is for convenience only,
          and the English language version will govern. TenInternships may remotely
          monitor Your use of the Business Services to ensure compliance with
          the Contract. If any provision of the Contract is unenforceable, that
          provision will be modified to render it enforceable to the extent
          possible to give effect to the parties’ intentions and the remaining
          provisions will not be affected.
