          insights, post and view relevant content, learn and develop skills,

          teninternships-branded apps, teninternships Learning and other
          teninternships-related sites, apps, communications and services

        <h2>Data we collect</h2>
        <p>
          We collect data to serve you and others better. You provide some of
          this data directly, such as when you create your account. We get some
          of it by recording how you interact with our services by, for example,
          using technologies like cookies, and receiving error reports or usage
          data from software running on your device. We also obtain data from
          third parties.
        </p>

        <h3>Data you provide to us</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Profile - </strong>
          You have choices about the information on your profile, such as your
          education, work experience, skills, photo, city or area and
          endorsements. You don’t have to provide additional information on your
          profile; however, profile information helps you to get more from our
          Services, including helping recruiters and business opportunities find
          you. It’s your choice whether to include sensitive information on your
          profile and to make that sensitive information public. Please do not
          post or add personal data to your profile that you would not want to
          be publicly available.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Registration - </strong>
          To create an account, you need to provide data including your name,
          email address and/or mobile number, and a password.
        </p>

      <section className="privacy__section" id="collection-usage">
        <h2>How we use your data</h2>
        <p>
          How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use,
          how you use those Services and the choices you make in your settings.
          We use the data that we have about you to provide and personalize our
          Services, including with the help of automated systems and inferences
          we make, so that our Services (including ads) can be more relevant and
          useful to you and others.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="privacy__section">
        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
          Our Services allow you to explore careers, evaluate educational
          opportunities, and seek out, and be found for, career opportunities.
          Your profile can be found by those looking to hire (for a internship or a
          specific task) or be hired by you. We will use your data to recommend
          internships or mentees, show you and others relevant professional contacts
          (e.g., who work at a company, in an industry, function or location or
          have certain skills and connections). You can signal that you are
          interested in changing internships and share information with recruiters. We
          will use your data to recommend internships to you and you to recruiters. We
          may use automated systems to provide content and recommendations to
          help make our Services more relevant to our Members, Visitors and
          customers. Keeping your profile accurate and up-to-date may help you
          better connect to others and to opportunities through our Services.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="privacy__section">
        <h2>Productivity</h2>
        <p>
          Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for
          potential clients, customers, partners and others to do business with.
          Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule
          and prepare meetings with them. If your settings allow, we scan
          messages to provide “bots” or similar tools that facilitate tasks such
          as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or
          recommending next steps. Learn more.

      <section className="privacy__section" id="information-sharing">
        <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>
          Any data that you include on your profile and any content you post or
          social action (e.g., likes, follows, comments, shares) you take on our
          Services will be seen by others.

      <section className="privacy__section" id="choices-obligations">
        <h2>Your choices and obligations</h2>
        <p>
          We generally retain your personal data as long as you keep your
          account open or as needed to provide you Services. This includes data
          you or others provided to us and data generated or inferred from your
          use of our Services. Even if you only use our Services when looking
          for a new internship every few years, we will retain your information and
          keep your profile open, unless you close your account. In some cases
          we choose to retain certain information (e.g., insights about Services
          use) in a depersonalized or aggregated form.
          <br />
					<br />
          We provide many choices about the collection, use and sharing of your
          data, from deleting or correcting data you include in your profile and
          controlling the visibility of your posts to advertising opt-outs and
          communication controls. We offer you settings to control and manage
          the personal data we have about you.

          <strong>Security - </strong>
          We implement security safeguards designed to protect your data, such
          as HTTPS. We regularly monitor our systems for possible
          vulnerabilities and attacks. However, we cannot warrant the security
          of any information that you send us. There is no guarantee that data
          may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any
          of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

          <strong>Children - </strong>
          Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware
          that your child has provided us with personal data without your
          consent, please contact us. We do not knowingly collect personal data
          from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has
          provided us with personal data, we take steps to remove such data and
          terminate the child’s account.
